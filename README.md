Rock vs Mine Prediction using Sonar Data

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. The dataset used contains sonar signals reflected off various surfaces, and the model classifies them accordingly.

ðŸš€ Features

Uses Sonar Dataset for classification.

Implements data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Trains a machine learning model for accurate predictions.

Evaluates the model's performance using different metrics.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of numerical values representing sonar signal frequencies. The target variable has two classes:

R â†’ Rock

M â†’ Mine
